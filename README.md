To simulate latch kinetics - run tetR_110219.m; figure(1) draws kinetics, figure(2) draws phase diagram; requires ODE file Model_tetR_110219.m

Fig. 5: run tetR_110219.m with t=[0 2], kt=0.03 (default kt=0.3), araon=0.5, araoff=0.7. For Fig. S5B,C: Ktet=10, for Fig. 5E,F: Ktet=0.01. Initial conditions: Fig. 5B - y0=[0*Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1*Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], Fig. 5E - y0=[0*Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1*Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.4 0.06], Fig. 5C,F - y0=[Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0*Dtot 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.5 0 0 0 0 0].

Fig. S10: run tetR_3D_110219.m for Fig. S10A-C; run tetR_3D_110219_int.m for Fig. S10D. Requires many hours of run, for faster runs reduce t.

Fig. S11: run tetR_110219.m with t=[0 24*5], araon=2.5, araoff=2.7. Initial conditions: Fig. S11A - y0=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01,Dtot,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.005,0,0,0,0.4,0.05], Fig. S11B - y0=[1*Dtot,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0*Dtot,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.06,0.01], Fig. S11C - y0=[0.6*Dtot,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.4*Dtot,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.06,0.01], Fig. S11D - figure(2) under initial conditions of Fig. S11A,B,C.

For simulations of plasmid segregation:

Fig. 6B: run pl_segr_110219.m

Fig. S13: run pl_segr_110219_hist.m with LR=3/20 (Fig. S14A,B); LR=10/20 (Fig. S14C,D); LR=17/20 (Fig. S14C,D).
Fig. S14: run tetR_110219.m with araon=0.5, araoff=0.7. Initial run - t=[0 24*6] to reach steady state; final run t=[0 24*4]; parameter period equal to 18, 14, 10, 6, 2 for panels A-E.
